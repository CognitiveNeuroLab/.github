<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## How to keep this index up-to-date
To find all the code we put online, we need some sort of overview. We have this by looking at this index. However this index only works if we all keep it up-to-date together. Plus once you make a change, you will be part of the contributors, so people can see that you worked on this. Showing that we do this all together.

### Who should add to this index
Anyone that adds a repo to the CNL page. It doesn't matter if you created it or if you only forked it. If you put it in the main CNL GitHub, you need to add to this index. If you do not do this, it might get deleted after a while to prevent us loosing track of what is what.

### When to add to this index
As soon as you add anything to the main CNL GitHub.

### How to add to this index
#### create a new Repo branch
create a new branch by clicking on the "main button" and typing a name for your new branch and clicking the create branch option. 
![opening a new branch](https://github.com/CognitiveNeuroLab/Index_overview_CNL/blob/main/image/new%20branch.PNG "new branch")

#### Adding a new sub-group
Let's say you are the first to create the subgroup "pipelines". You look below the line that says "## index" and look alphabetically where it goes. Since it's a subgroup, you put 2 # before the name + 1 space. 
After that you need to add this also to the table of content. You do this by scrolling up to the table of content, look where your subgroup goes and add it there by writing the title as is in between [] directly followed by the title without capitals and spaces/underscores replaced by - in-between ().
Make sure there is the same amount of indents as for the other sub-groups.
#### adding a Repo
Find the right subgroup and lets say in this case you want to upload your pipeline. Look for "### pipelines", and see where your pipeline goes alphabetically. add 4 # before the name of your repo. Then enter the name of your repo between []followed by the URL inside (). 
In the line below write a quick explanation with at least the following info, year when uploaded, who created the Fork, what language you used, references if they exist. You can add more, but try to keep it as short as possible, since every repo should have a readme that explains itself. 
After that you need to add this also to the table of content. You do this by scrolling up to the table of content, look for your subgroup and add it below there (alphabetically) by writing the title as is in between [] directly followed by the title without capitals and spaces/underscores replaced by - in-between ().
Make sure there is the same amount of indents as for the other repos.
#### combining the new and the original branch
After saving all the changes you made in the new branch. Click on the "pull requests button". Click the green "New pull request" button. Make sure you are comparing the right branches with each other. This means the "main" branch should be the first box and whatever you called yours should be in the one on the right. After that you hit "create pull request" two times. If correct you can now choose "merge pull request". After this you should delete your old branch.

## Index
The index is divided in sub-groups. If your repo does not fall within a subgroup, feel free to create a new one.
