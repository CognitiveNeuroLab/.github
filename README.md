# Index_overview_CNL

I think we should add here things per repository (that we talked about before)

This DOES NOT needs to be added in a different file than readme file . I originally thought this, so we could add the whole index in here if we prefer.

I think we should defintly think what info we need on each repository. It should not be too much per repository but also clear.
